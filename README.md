* Some Thoughts on the Use of Word*

a concise guide to extracting maximal value from the _de facto_ word processor

Microsoft Word is the de facto writing tool. I like to learn the “ins and outs” of
the tools I use heavily, and wanted to share things I’ve found helpful in using Word 
effectively. This paper captures various thoughts, ideas, and suggestions, as well 
as pointers for digging much deeper than this and really becoming a Word power user, 
if you’re so inclined. This is presented in the spirit of “you won’t use it if you 
don’t know it’s there”. These ideas are applicable to all document types, but by 
their nature the benefit of applying them increases as document size, complexity, 
and editing time increase. I find it beneficial, however, to make a habit of using 
styles and other good formatting practices even for very short documents because it 
makes things very predictable.
